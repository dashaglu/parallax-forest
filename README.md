# Parallax forest
Hi, it's a small landing page with parallax effect.
Live demo you can find [here](https://dashaglu.github.io/parallax-forest/).

I've created this parallax effect using:
- changing the value of ```translate3d``` value of ```transform``` css property. I used value lower than ```scrollY``` value of ```body``` element;
- to make scroll smoother I used [gsap library](https://greensock.com/gsap/).
